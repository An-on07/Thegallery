# Thegallery
A full-stack web application designed to showcase and sell handmade charms online. The main objective of this project is to implement a backend-focused architecture while still providing a functional frontend for end users.

# Features

* **Order Management** (place orders, track status)
* **Cart System** (add/remove charms to cart)
* **RESTful API** for frontend consumption
* **Database Integration** (persistent data storage)
* **Validation & Error Handling** for secure and reliable backend

## Frontend (Minimal but Functional)

* Homepage with charms listing
* Product details page
* Shopping cart UI
* Checkout page
* Simple admin dashboard (manage products)
